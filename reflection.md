- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
For the Library and the House class, I decided to overload the showOptions(), goToFloors(), goUp(), and goDown(). I thought it made sense to allow people to go up and down the floors as they please. 
For the Cafe class, I overloaded the enter and exit function to it since goUp and goDown methods were inappropriate.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Everything went alright for me but I did have some trouble trying to get the building class. The terminal kept telling me that my building class could not be found which was very confusing, but I figured it out after looking in the discord to see if anyone else had the same problem (they did). My advice is to definitely check the discord in case you run into trouble because, chances are someone has the same question.
